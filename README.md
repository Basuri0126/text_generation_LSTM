# text_generation_LSTM
> This is text generative model with fine-tuning LSTM model
> I also extract data from Project Gutenberg website for text data

Implemented a character-level LSTM model for text generation in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The project involved preprocessing a dataset, creating mappings between characters and integers, and training the LSTM network to predict the next character in a sequence. The model was designed with 256 LSTM units, followed by a dropout layer for regularization, and a softmax-activated dense layer for character prediction. The trained model was loaded with pre-trained weights, allowing it to generate creative and grammatically correct text based on a given seed sequence. Achievements include achieving a 6 perplexity score and successfully integrating the model into a text generation pipeline.
